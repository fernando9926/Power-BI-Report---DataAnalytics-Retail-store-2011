# Power-BI-Report---DataAnalytics-Retail-store-2011

this was in collaboration with the Tata consulting firm "TCS" I participated in Tata's work simulation on the Forage platform.

worked on a project to help a retail customer review their revenue data to prepare for the future.

We analyzed the location of customers and their sales, identifying the regions with the highest growth potential based on observed trends ignoring the core country which in this case is UK. In particular, the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland show promising growth because they are our most profitable countries after the UK.

We also identify different customer segments, each with unique characteristics and behaviors. We propose customized strategies for each segment, highlighting specific opportunities to maximize customer retention and acquisition. Detailed analysis of sales data enabled us to identify the most profitable products.
